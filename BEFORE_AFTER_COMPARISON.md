## Dataset Configuration

| Setting | BEFORE (Current) | AFTER (Expected) | Impact |
|---------|------------------|------------------|--------|
| **Tile Size** | 512×512 | 256×256 | 4× more tiles |
| **Tile Overlap** | 64 px | 32 px | Proportional |
| **min_valid_fraction** | 0.5-0.55 | 0.4 | More tiles pass filter |
| **positive_min_fraction** | 0.01 (1%) | 0.005 (0.5%) | More tiles accepted |
| **positive_fraction** | 0.5 (50%) | 0.3 (30%) | Better balance |

## Dataset Splits

### BEFORE (Current - BROKEN)
```
Training Area: 1574 × 1607 pixels
Tile Size: 512 × 512
Possible Positions: ~9
After Filtering: 8 tiles

Split Distribution:
├── Train: 8 tiles (100%) ✓
├── Val:   0 tiles (0%)   ❌ EMPTY
└── Test:  0 tiles (0%)   ❌ EMPTY

Issue: 8 × 0.15 = 1.2 → rounds to 0
       8 × 0.20 = 1.6 → rounds to 0
```

### AFTER (Expected - FIXED)
```
Training Area: 1574 × 1607 pixels
Tile Size: 256 × 256
Possible Positions: ~36
After Filtering: ~32 tiles (expected)

Split Distribution:
├── Train: ~21 tiles (65%) ✓
├── Val:   ~5 tiles (15%)  ✓ NOW EXISTS
└── Test:  ~6 tiles (20%)  ✓ NOW EXISTS

Fix: 32 × 0.15 = 4.8 → rounds to 5
     32 × 0.20 = 6.4 → rounds to 6
```

## Training Metrics

### BEFORE (Current - INVALID)
```json
{
  "train_loss": [0.523, 0.412, ...],
  "train_macro_iou": [0.45, 0.58, ...],
  "val_loss": [NaN, NaN, NaN],        ❌ No validation
  "val_macro_iou": [NaN, NaN, NaN],   ❌ No validation
  "best_epoch": 20,
  "best_val_macro_iou": NaN           ❌ Cannot select best model
}
```

**Problem:** Model cannot be properly validated or early-stopped!

### AFTER (Expected - VALID)
```json
{
  "train_loss": [0.523, 0.412, 0.350, ...],
  "train_macro_iou": [0.45, 0.58, 0.64, ...],
  "val_loss": [0.612, 0.495, 0.428, ...],      ✓ Has values
  "val_macro_iou": [0.38, 0.51, 0.55, ...],    ✓ Has values
  "best_epoch": 15,
  "best_val_macro_iou": 0.55                   ✓ Proper selection
}
```

**Fixed:** Model can now be validated and best checkpoint selected!

## Model Predictions

### BEFORE (Current - UNREALISTIC)
```
Susceptibility Statistics:
  Mean:   0.9098  ⚠️ WAY TOO HIGH
  Median: 0.9723  ⚠️ WAY TOO HIGH
  Std:    0.1470
  Min:    0.0537
  Max:    1.0000

Risk Distribution:
  High Risk (>0.7):      92.38%  🔴 UNREALISTIC
  Moderate Risk (0.3-0.7): 6.71%
  Low Risk (<0.3):         0.91%

Interpretation: Model predicts almost everything as high risk!
```

### AFTER (Expected - REALISTIC)
```
Susceptibility Statistics:
  Mean:   0.35-0.45  ✓ Reasonable
  Median: 0.30-0.50  ✓ Reasonable
  Std:    0.20-0.30  ✓ Better spread
  Min:    0.00-0.10
  Max:    0.90-1.00

Risk Distribution:
  High Risk (>0.7):      10-30%  ✓ More realistic
  Moderate Risk (0.3-0.7): 30-50%
  Low Risk (<0.3):         30-50%

Interpretation: Model now produces balanced risk predictions!
```

## Root Cause Summary

### The Problem
```
Input Area: 1574×1607 = 2.5M pixels
Tile Size: 512×512 = 262K pixels per tile
Possible Tiles: ~9 positions
After Filtering: 8 tiles

8 tiles × 0.15 = 1.2 → rounds to 0 val tiles ❌
8 tiles × 0.20 = 1.6 → rounds to 0 test tiles ❌
```

### The Solution
```
Input Area: 1574×1607 = 2.5M pixels  (unchanged)
Tile Size: 256×256 = 65K pixels per tile  (4× smaller)
Possible Tiles: ~36 positions
After Filtering: ~32 tiles (with relaxed thresholds)

32 tiles × 0.15 = 4.8 → rounds to 5 val tiles ✓
32 tiles × 0.20 = 6.4 → rounds to 6 test tiles ✓
```

## How to Regenerate

Run the automated script:
```bash
./regenerate_artifacts.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
.venv/bin/python -m src.main_pipeline --force_recreate
```

**Duration:** ~30-55 minutes  
**Result:** All issues should be resolved!

---

## Verification Commands

After regeneration, verify the fixes:

```bash
# Check tile counts
cat artifacts/splits/dataset_summary.json | jq '.tile_counts'

# Count files
ls artifacts/tiles/train/*.npy | wc -l
ls artifacts/tiles/val/*.npy | wc -l
ls artifacts/tiles/test/*.npy | wc -l

# Check validation metrics
cat artifacts/experiments/training_metrics.json | jq '.val_macro_iou[-1]'

# Check susceptibility statistics
cat outputs/evaluation/output_statistics.json | jq '.susceptibility_stats.mean'

# Check risk distribution
cat outputs/evaluation/output_statistics.json | jq '.risk_distribution.high_risk'
```

---

**Summary:** Configuration is fixed ✅, now awaiting artifact regeneration with `--force_recreate`
