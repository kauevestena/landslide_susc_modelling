# Ordinal 3-Class Landslide Susceptibility - Pipeline Fix

## Problem Summary

The evaluation metrics were showing terrible performance (AUROC ~0.50, random chance) due to a **fundamental mismatch** between the ground truth encoding and the evaluation strategy.

### Ground Truth Encoding
Your ground truth raster contains 3 discrete values representing **ordinal landslide probability**:
- **Class 1**: Low landslide probability
- **Class 2**: Medium landslide probability  
- **Class 3**: High landslide probability

### What Was Wrong

1. **Training was correct**: Ground truth values 1,2,3 were properly remapped to 0,1,2 during tiling (see `src/main_pipeline.py` line 1069-1070)

2. **Inference was incomplete**: Only saved the probability of class 2 (high risk) as a single-band `susceptibility.tif`, discarding probabilities for classes 0 and 1

3. **Evaluation was broken**: The `evaluate.py` script assumed class 2 (medium) was "positive landslide" and classes 1 + 3 were "negative" - completely wrong for an ordinal problem!

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Inference (`src/inference.py`)

**Changes:**
- **Ordinal Susceptibility Score**: Computed weighted average of class probabilities:
  ```
  susceptibility_ordinal = 0.0 * P(low) + 0.5 * P(medium) + 1.0 * P(high)
  ```
  This gives a continuous measure from 0 (definitely low risk) to 1 (definitely high risk)

- **High-Risk Probability**: Still save the calibrated probability of class 2 (high risk) separately

- **All Class Probabilities**: Save a 3-band GeoTIFF containing P(class 0), P(class 1), P(class 2)

**New Outputs:**
- `test_susceptibility.tif` - **Ordinal weighted score** (primary output)
- `test_susceptibility_high.tif` - Calibrated probability of high risk (class 2)
- `test_class_probabilities.tif` - 3-band raster with all class probabilities
- `test_uncertainty.tif` - Uncertainty estimate
- `test_class_map.tif` - Argmax class predictions
- `test_valid_mask.tif` - Valid pixel mask

### 2. Evaluation (`src/evaluate.py`)

**Changes:**
- **Multi-Strategy Evaluation**: Evaluate the ordinal problem from multiple perspectives:

  **Strategy 1**: High Risk (class 3) vs Rest (classes 1-2)
  - Treats only the highest risk class as positive
  - Useful for identifying critical zones

  **Strategy 2**: At-Risk (classes 2-3) vs Low (class 1)
  - Treats medium+high as positive
  - Useful for broader risk assessment

  **Strategy 3**: Ordinal Correlation
  - Computes Spearman's rank correlation between predicted probabilities and ground truth classes
  - Measures how well the model preserves the ordinal relationship

- **Comprehensive Metrics**: For each binary strategy, compute:
  - AUROC, AUPRC (threshold-independent)
  - Accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall, Specificity, IoU
  - Optimal thresholds (Youden's J and F1-maximizing)
  - ROC and PR curves

**New Metrics Structure:**
```json
{
  "ground_truth_encoding": {
    "class_1": "Low landslide probability",
    "class_2": "Medium landslide probability",
    "class_3": "High landslide probability"
  },
  "ground_truth_distribution": { ... },
  "ordinal_correlation": {
    "spearman_rho": 0.85,
    "p_value": 1.2e-10
  },
  "strategy_1_high_vs_rest": {
    "auroc": 0.92,
    "auprc": 0.87,
    ...
  },
  "strategy_2_risk_vs_low": {
    "auroc": 0.89,
    "auprc": 0.84,
    ...
  }
}
```

### 3. Configuration (Future Enhancement)

Consider adding to `config.yaml`:
```yaml
evaluation:
  # How to interpret 3-class output for evaluation
  class_interpretation:
    low: 1    # Low probability
    medium: 2 # Medium probability
    high: 3   # High probability
  
  # Which strategies to use
  strategies:
    - high_vs_rest       # Class 3 vs 1-2
    - risk_vs_low        # Classes 2-3 vs 1
    - ordinal_correlation  # Spearman correlation
```

## How to Use

### Activate Virtual Environment (REQUIRED)
```bash
# ALWAYS activate .venv first!
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# OR on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Run Inference
```bash
# With venv activated:
python -m src.main_pipeline
```

This will generate all outputs including the new ordinal susceptibility and class probabilities.

### Run Evaluation
```bash
# With venv activated:
python -m src.evaluate \
  --susceptibility outputs/test_susceptibility.tif \
  --ground_truth /home/kaue/data/landslide/training/Ground_truth_train.tif \
  --output_dir outputs/evaluation
```

This will:
1. Evaluate using both binary strategies
2. Compute ordinal correlation
3. Generate ROC/PR curves for each strategy
4. Save comprehensive metrics to `outputs/evaluation/evaluation_metrics.json`
5. Generate report to `outputs/evaluation/evaluation_report.md`

### Interpret Results

**Ordinal Correlation (Spearman's ρ)**:
- Close to 1.0: Model correctly ranks pixels by landslide probability
- Close to 0.0: No ordinal relationship
- Negative: Model is anti-correlated (very bad!)

**Strategy 1 (High vs Rest)**:
- High AUROC/AUPRC: Model effectively identifies highest-risk areas
- Use this to prioritize critical interventions

**Strategy 2 (At-Risk vs Low)**:
- High AUROC/AUPRC: Model distinguishes risky areas from safe ones
- Use this for broader hazard mapping

## Expected Improvements

After these fixes, you should see:

✅ **AUROC > 0.80**: Model has good discrimination ability
✅ **Spearman's ρ > 0.70**: Strong ordinal relationship preserved
✅ **AUPRC meaningful**: Depends on class balance, but should be >> random baseline
✅ **Sensible confusion matrices**: Errors mostly between adjacent classes (1↔2 or 2↔3, not 1↔3)

## Files Modified

1. `src/inference.py`:
   - Added `write_multiband_geotiff()` function
   - Compute ordinal susceptibility score
   - Save all class probabilities
   - Updated output paths

2. `src/evaluate.py`:
   - Added `evaluate_binary_strategy()` function
   - Implemented multi-strategy evaluation
   - Compute Spearman correlation
   - Updated report generation

3. `src/evaluate_multiclass.py`:
   - Created standalone evaluation script (optional alternative)

## Next Steps

1. **Re-run inference** on test area to generate new outputs
2. **Run evaluation** with fixed script to get proper metrics
3. **Analyze results** using multiple strategies to understand model performance
4. **Consider model improvements** if ordinal correlation is low:
   - Use ordinal regression loss instead of cross-entropy
   - Add class-distance weighting to penalize distant misclassifications more
   - Adjust class weights if severely imbalanced

## Technical Notes

- Ground truth values 1,2,3 are remapped to 0,1,2 internally for PyTorch (zero-indexed)
- Model outputs are softmax probabilities summing to 1.0 across the 3 classes
- Ordinal susceptibility = weighted combination emphasizing higher risk classes
- Calibration is applied only to high-risk probability, not ordinal score (consider extending)
